#  Machine Learning Projects 
Here is the four main projects for the Machine Learning with Python course.


This repository showcases my hands-on projects in machine learning using real-world datasets and Python libraries. Each project explores a different branch of machine learning, including regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. ðŸ“‰ **Housing Price Regression**
**Notebook:** `Regression_Project.ipynb`  
**Objective:** Predict house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, and amenities.  
**Features Used:**
- Area, Rooms, Parking, Warehouse, Elevator, Address  
**Techniques Used:**
- Linear Regression
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score  
**Outcome:** Built a regression model to estimate property prices in both Toman and USD.

### 2. ðŸ©º **Heart Disease Classification**
**Notebook:** `Classification_project.ipynb`  
**Objective:** Predict whether a patient is at high or low risk of heart disease based on medical features.  
**Features Used:**
- Age, Sex, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, ECG Results
- Chest Pain Type, Fasting Blood Sugar, Exercise Angina
- Max Heart Rate, Major Vessels Count  
**Techniques Used:**
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Classification Report
- Feature Importance Visualization  
**Outcome:** Built a classifier to assist in early detection of cardiovascular risks.

### 3. ðŸ“Š **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**
**Notebook:** `Clustering_project.ipynb`  
**Objective:** Segment mall customers based on demographic and behavioral data.  
**Techniques Used:**
- KMeans Clustering (with Elbow Method)
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Silhouette Score for evaluation  
**Outcome:** Identified customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

### 4. ðŸŽ¬ **Movie Recommendation System**
**Notebook:** `Recommender_project.ipynb` (Parts 2 & 3)  
**Objective:** Recommend movies using both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.  
**Content-Based Filtering Techniques:**
- Genre one-hot encoding
- User profile vector construction
- Dot product similarity and score ranking  
**Collaborative Filtering Techniques:**
- Pearson correlation similarity
- Weighted average recommendation scoring  
**Outcome:** Built a hybrid recommender system that generates personalized movie suggestions.
